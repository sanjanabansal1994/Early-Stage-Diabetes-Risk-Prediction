# Early-Stage-Diabetes-Risk-Prediction

## Introduction

As part of the Data Science Certificate program at the University of Torontoâ€™s Data Sciences Institute for our capstone team project, we chose the "Early-Stage-Diabetes-Risk-Prediction" dataset. This project explores the which demographic and clinical features are the most significant predictors of early-stage diabetes risk among individuals. From data exploration to creating different models to generate actionable insights, this project demonstrates our accomplishments throughout the certification program and highlights our potential to contribute to the data science field.
