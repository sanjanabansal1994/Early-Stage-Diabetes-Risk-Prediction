# Early-Stage-Diabetes-Risk-Prediction

## Introduction

As part of the Data Science Certificate program at the University of Toronto’s Data Sciences Institute for our capstone team project, we chose the "Early-Stage-Diabetes-Risk-Prediction" dataset. This project explores the which demographic and clinical features are the most significant predictors of early-stage diabetes risk among individuals. From data exploration to creating different models to generate actionable insights, this project demonstrates our accomplishments throughout the certification program and highlights our potential to contribute to the data science field.

## Business Case

Insurance companies face challenges in assessing health risks and underwriting policies effectively. Early-stage diabetes, if undetected, can lead to severe health complications, increasing long-term claims and costs. A predictive model that accurately identifies individuals at risk of developing diabetes enables insurers to:

- Offer personalized health plans and proactive interventions
- Optimize premium pricing based on risk assessment
- Reduce long-term healthcare claims by encouraging early lifestyle changes

Our Early-Stage Diabetes Risk Prediction Model leverages machine learning and feature selection techniques to enhance the accuracy of risk assessment. By focusing on the most significant predictors, the model minimizes overfitting and improves performance metrics such as **F-measure, Precision-Recall Curve, and ROC-AUC**, ensuring robust decision-making for insurers.

## Business Impact

For insurance companies, integrating this predictive model into underwriting and policy management can:

- Improve Risk Stratification – Accurately segment policyholders based on diabetes risk.
- Personalized Premiums & Coverage – Offer dynamic pricing based on real-time health insights.
- Encourage Preventive Health Measures – Engage customers with targeted wellness programs.
- Reduce Claims & Improve Profitability – Lower long-term medical costs through early intervention strategies.
- By adopting data-driven risk prediction, insurers can enhance customer satisfaction, reduce uncertainties in policy underwriting, and drive business growth through proactive healthcare solutions.
